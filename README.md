# metrica_analysis
Working with Metrica Sports open tracking data

This repo contains some Python scripts that people may find useful when exploring the Metrica open tracking and event data sample files

Currently there are example scripts to:

* Evaluate sprinting/movement profiles
* Look at average position data both in and out of possession

There is also a utilities file which provides some functions to help manipulate the data files for simpler anlysis. The aim being that they may save some people some time or make it easuer to get started.

The focus of this repo is functionality, everything should Just Work <sup>TM</sup> with the sample data even though some solutions may be a bit hacky for the time being. I don't know what a production Metrica data set looks like so I don't want to spend too much time devising robust code, but rather just start exploring the data.
